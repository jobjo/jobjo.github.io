Jeykll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
